        The School of Art is one of Yale’s Graduate & Professional Schools
        conferring MFA degrees in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking,
        Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses
        to Yale College students. Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative
        experiment in digital publishing and information sharing. It functions
        as a wiki—all members of the School of Art community have the ability to
        add new, and edit most existing content.

        <h3>From our friends at the Yale Center for Environmental Justice</h3>
        <p>
          The Yale Center for Environmental Justice is in the process of
          planning our fourth annual Global Environmental Justice Conference,
          with this year focusing on the theme of “Environmental Joy.” The
          conference aims to explore the ways in which environmental and climate
          justice and the communities engaged in that work generate joy. Guided
          by the notion that the ultimate goal of most environmental and climate
          work is to alleviate suffering and increase wellbeing, Environmental
          Joy will explore and celebrate the diverse ways that environmental
          justice achieves this goal.<br /><br />One facet of the conference
          programming we hope to organize is a juried art show soliciting works
          from artists around the world on the theme of Environmental Joy to be
          showcased in an exhibition during the conference. We are currently
          seeking any interested students or faculty who would be interested in
          supporting the planning and execution of this call for art. If you’re
          interested in learning more about the opportunity, please contact
          Julia Simon at julia.simon@yale.edu.

        <h3>
          Faculty/Alumni: Post Your Art Apprenticeship/Internship Opportunities
          for Undergraduates
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an initiative that connects
          Yale undergraduates, particularly those on financial aid, with
          professional arts practitioners of any discipline. As an option within
          Yale’s Summer Experience Award (SEA) funding model, the Arts
          Apprenticeship must fulfill the same basic requirements. Additional
          details, as well as those specific to the Arts Apprenticeship are
          included below. Yale faculty, alumni, or other arts practitioners
          interested in featuring positions through the program should contact
          Yale’s Creative Careers advisor. Which Opportunities are Eligible?
          Must be at least 30 hours/week, for at least 8-weeks over the summer
          months. Those 8-weeks do not have to be continuous if the mentoring
          Arts Practitioner agrees on a different schedule. The time commitment
          need not all be in direct contact with the Arts Practitioner.
          Independent projects, tasks, research, etc. can comprise much of the
          experience, as long as the Arts Practitioner is checking in regularly
          with the student to provide oversight and career-based context. The
          opportunity cannot be with a for-profit organization. The engagement
          for an Arts Apprenticeship should be directly with an individual Arts
          Practitioner and not with a company. The only exception to this would
          be if the company overseeing the apprenticeship were a registered
          non-profit organization.<br /><br />For more information:

          out to Assistant Director of Communications Lindsey Mancini if they
