            <h3>From our friends at the Yale Center for Environmental Justice</h3>
            <p>The Yale Center for Environmental Justice is in the process of planning our fourth annual Global Environmental Justice Conference, with this year focusing on the theme of “Environmental Joy.” The conference aims to explore the ways in which environmental and climate justice and the communities engaged in that work generate joy. Guided by the notion that the ultimate goal of most environmental and climate work is to alleviate suffering and increase wellbeing, Environmental Joy will explore and celebrate the diverse ways that environmental justice achieves this goal.
                <br><br>One facet of the conference programming we hope to organize is a juried art show soliciting works from artists around the world on the theme of Environmental Joy to be showcased in an exhibition during the conference. We are currently seeking any interested students or faculty who would be interested in supporting the planning and execution of this call for art. If you’re interested in learning more about the opportunity, please contact Julia Simon at julia.simon@yale.edu.</p>
